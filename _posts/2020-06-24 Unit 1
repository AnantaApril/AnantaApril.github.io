As I embarked upon this adventure into the world of diabetes, I expected to find that there would be a relationship between taking certain medications and the time they spent in the hospiital. After several tries of working with that question, I discovered that what I really wanted to know was basically whether there seemed to be a higher occurence of being re-admitted to the hospital if you were on certain medications. I started with a set of about 25 different medications, then narrowed that down to just a couple for examples. What I did notice is that you see more people on insulin being re-admitted than Metformin, but it does not seem that taking insulin by itself is not related to whether or not they are re-admitted
